# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)

    description: 'Focus on comfort at your next group event with this Hanes Authentic Crewneck Short Sleeve Tâ€‘shirt. Formerly the tagless t-shirt, this Hanes is a true original. With a tear away label for added comfort and rebranding, we (and our necks) are truly grateful. These custom tear away tag tees are sturdy and durable. They are a great basic tee, but you already know that because you probably already have some of these in your closet.',
